## Site Layout

There are 3 offering levels of KeyDB: <strong>KeyDB Cloud, KeyDB Open Source,</strong> and <strong>KeyDB Enterprise</strong>. Because KeyDB Cloud and Enterprise can be considered a superset of Open Source, all documentation is applicable to all offerings unless its specified as a subcategory under Cloud/Enterprise/Open Source.

KeyDB Cloud and Enterprise use the same binary packages, so the feature set and some of the documentation is the same, however the cloud offering is fully managed with a GUI for simplified, automated operations.


## Compatability

KeyDB remains up to date with the current version of Redis and as such maintains compatibility with standard Redis API's and protocols. Front-end tools, Redis clients, API's and modules will work with KeyDB. KeyDB is a drop in alternative to Redis. You can see more in [migration](https://docs.keydb.dev/docs/migration)

KeyDB is compatible with all Redis clients as listed [here](https://redis.io/clients) so this should not be a concern. Simply use your client as you would with Redis.
